# dwmblocks-haiyang

my own dwmblocks setup. The scripts are mostly taken from my old `dwm-bar` scripts in my `dwm-haiyang` setup.
I did not add the clickable modules on dwmblocks feature because I don't think I need it. If you want it you can go check out luke's setup at https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks.

To compile dwmblocks: `sudo make clean install`

The config file is named `blocks.h`.
